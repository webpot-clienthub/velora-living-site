# TODO: Implement UX Flow and Loading Animations

## Steps to Complete

- [x] Add loading animation to index.html and style.css (full-screen loader that fades out after site loads)
- [x] Update index.html: Remove hardcoded product sections, enhance JS for dynamic loading, add zoom overlay, size selection, and WhatsApp generation
- [x] Update style.css: Add styles for zoom overlay, larger image display, size buttons, background dimming, animations, and loading spinner
- [ ] Test the flow on mobile and desktop, verify WhatsApp URL generation and opening
- [ ] Ensure smooth animations, no page reloads, and mobile-first touch-friendly design
